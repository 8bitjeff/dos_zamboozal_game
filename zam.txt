Zamboozal Poker dice.

This is a yahtzee style game written in C++.  It will run on any color PC.
You don't have to install it.  Just put it in a directory all by itself,
and run it from dos, or create a short-cut to it in progrm manager.

If you create a short cut in Windows 95, be sure to check the
"Close On Exit" option on the Properties tab.  It will make the game
window close when done.

The game was my first real attempt at designing a large C game.
The highscore system will save all of the history information for the
top 5 games.  You can go back and see exactly how you did, and what you
did to get a high score.

Check it out.
